## Mosquito-Haemolymph-Larvae-Research

_Objectives_ : 
1) Small project on mosquito larvae homolymph circulation with live imaging with light microscopy and basic ImageJ analysis to the data to quantify the frequency of the pumping and direction of flow.

2) A paper to prove, "opposite direction of haemolymph flow in larvae" (2015) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4317240/

3) Time lapse microscopy and ImageJ analysis revealed that the larval heart beats at more or less constant pace; each contraction originates at the posterior of the abdomen and propagates towards the head in a wave like fashion. Moreover, unlike the adult heart, the larval heart maintains an exclusive anterograde hemolymph flow without allowing any directional reversals.

### Edit :
1) https://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/3/370.abstract - "Comparative structural and functional analysis of the larval and adult dorsal vessel and its role in hemolymph circulation in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae"

2) https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/4/541.full - "Structural mechanics of the mosquito heart and its function in bidirectional hemolymph transport"

//Wonderful papers to read and comment on the issue.
